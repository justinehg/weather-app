- A weather app that displays the temperature, humidity, and wind speed of your desired location. Now, the temperature is in Celcius, as I developed this application to display the weather in any city worldwide. For a little of "spice", I designed the background image to show a landmark or a special trait that represent the current location shown. 
- For example: Paris = Eiffel Towel, New York City = Statue of Liberty.
